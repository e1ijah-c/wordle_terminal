# wordle_terminal

> **The classic game _Wordle_, but remade using python and playable in your (mac) terminal.**

### _Download Steps_

1. Ensure that [python is installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer.
2. Download the project the project, and open the zip.
3. Right-click the project folder and hold the _option_ key, then select 'Copy "wordle_terminal-main" as Pathname'.
4. Open a new terminal, and type 'cd' + _*the pathname your just copied._
5. Type in "python3 wordle_terminal.py", and the game should run.

This is a small project I have done to improve my python knowledge (_and yes, I know you can play Wordle in your browser_).
