# wordle_terminal

> **The classic game _Wordle_, but remade using python and playable in your (mac) terminal.**

### _Download Steps_

1. Ensure that [python is installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer.
2. Ensure that [pip is installed](https://macpaw.com/how-to/install-pip-mac) on your computer (run `python3 -m ensurepip` in terminal)
3. Run the command `pip install colorama` in terminal (needed to see colours in terminal). 
4. Download the project the project, and open the zip.
5. Right-click the project folder and hold the _option_ key, then select 'Copy "wordle_terminal-main" as Pathname'.
6. Open a new terminal, and type 'cd' + _*the pathname your just copied._
7. Run the command `python3 wordle_terminal.py`, and the game should run.

This is a small project I have done to improve my python knowledge (_and yes, I know you can play Wordle in your browser_).
